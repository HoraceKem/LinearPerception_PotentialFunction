  ## Preparation
 Installing dependency packages may change your packages' version, so it would be a good choice to create a virtual

```
conda create -n PR_Task2 python=3.7
conda activate PR_Task2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running
Change to folder ```sources``` and command:   
```
python linear.py [<options>] 
``` 
or
```
python nonlinear.py [<options>] 
```
```[<options>]```can change the default args, including:  
+ cluster number
+ sample number per cluster
+ center points of clusters
